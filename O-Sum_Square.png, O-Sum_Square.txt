This program calculates the Lowest Common multiple 
for excessively long input values
  
function lcmNaive(Argument one, Argument two){
  
    Calculate the lowest common variable of Argument
    1 and Argument 2 by dividing their product by their
    Greatest common divisor product
  
    return lowest common multiple
end
}
function greatestCommonDivisor(Argument one, Argument two){
    if Argument two is equal to zero
        then return Argument one
  
    return the greatest common divisor
  
end
}

In the main function
     
   print prompt "Input two numbers"
         
   Take the first number from the user
   Take the second number from the user
  
   Send the first number and second number 
   to the lcmNaive function and print
   the result to the user   
}
